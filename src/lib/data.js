        testimonial:
            "I didn’t want a website—too much hassle—but my wholesaler said it’d help with bigger orders. WebSol made something simple, and now I’m getting calls from nearby shops for rice and dal. It’s maybe 10-15 extra sacks a month. Cost me a bit, but it’s fine, I suppose."

        testimonial:
            "My son kept saying, ‘Ma, go online,’ so I tried WebSol. They put my tiffin menu on a page—nothing fancy. Now some office people order daily, maybe 5-10 more tiffins than before. I still don’t get how it works, but they didn’t charge me crazy money."

        testimonial:
            "A customer told me I’d sell more spare parts with a website, so I got WebSol to do it. It’s basic—just lists what I’ve got. Some mechanics from the next town started messaging me on WhatsApp after seeing it. Business is up a little, not huge, but enough to keep it."
